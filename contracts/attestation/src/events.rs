//! # Structured Event Emissions for Attestations
//!
//! This module defines and emits structured, indexable events for the
//! attestation contract lifecycle. Events are designed for compatibility
//! with off-chain indexers and analytics tools.
//!
//! ## Event Types
//!
//! | Event                | Description                                    |
//! |----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
//! | AttestationSubmitted | Emitted when a new attestation is submitted    |
//! | AttestationRevoked   | Emitted when an attestation is revoked         |
//! | AttestationMigrated  | Emitted when an attestation is migrated        |
//! | RoleGranted          | Emitted when a role is granted to an address   |
//! | RoleRevoked          | Emitted when a role is revoked from an address |
//! | ContractPaused       | Emitted when the contract is paused            |
//! | ContractUnpaused     | Emitted when the contract is unpaused          |
//!
//! ## Event Schema
//!
//! Events include:
//! - Topic: Event type identifier for filtering
//! - Data: Structured payload with relevant fields
//!
//! Events are designed to:
//! - Be indexable by off-chain systems
//! - Include all relevant context without sensitive data
//! - Support correlation across related events
