# Veritasor Contracts

Soroban smart contracts for the Veritasor revenue attestation protocol on Stellar. Store revenue Merkle roots and metadata on-chain; full data remains off-chain.

## Contract: `attestation`

Stores one attestation per (business address, period). Each attestation is a Merkle root (32 bytes), timestamp, version, and the fee paid. Duplicate (business, period) submissions are rejected.

### Dynamic Fee Schedule

The contract supports a tiered, volume-based fee system. Fees are denominated in a configurable Soroban token and collected on each attestation submission.

- **Tier discounts**: Businesses are assigned tiers (Standard, Professional, Enterprise, or custom) with configurable discounts in basis points.
- **Volume discounts**: Cumulative attestation count triggers bracket-based discounts.
- **Backward compatible**: When fees are not configured or disabled, attestations are free.

See [docs/attestation-dynamic-fees.md](docs/attestation-dynamic-fees.md) for the full specification, economic rationale, and configuration guide.

### Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `initialize(admin)` | One-time setup. Sets the admin address. |
| `configure_fees(token, collector, base_fee, enabled)` | Admin: set fee token, collector, base fee, and toggle. |
| `set_tier_discount(tier, discount_bps)` | Admin: set discount (0–10 000 bps) for a tier level. |
| `set_business_tier(business, tier)` | Admin: assign a business to a tier. |
| `set_volume_brackets(thresholds, discounts)` | Admin: set volume discount brackets. |
| `set_fee_enabled(enabled)` | Admin: toggle fee collection on/off. |
| `submit_attestation(business, period, merkle_root, timestamp, version)` | Store attestation; collects fee if enabled. Business must authorize. |
| `get_attestation(business, period)` | Returns `Option<(BytesN<32>, u64, u32, i128)>` (root, ts, ver, fee_paid). |
| `verify_attestation(business, period, merkle_root)` | Returns `true` if attestation exists and root matches. |
| `get_fee_config()` | Current fee configuration or None. |
| `get_fee_quote(business)` | Fee the business would pay for its next attestation. |
| `get_business_tier(business)` | Tier assigned to a business (0 if unset). |
| `get_business_count(business)` | Cumulative attestation count. |
| `get_admin()` | Contract admin address. |

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+
- Soroban CLI (optional, for deployment): [Stellar Soroban docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts)

### Setup

```bash
# Install Rust (if needed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Add wasm target for Soroban
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Build the contract
cd contracts/attestation
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

The `.wasm` artifact will be in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/veritasor_attestation.wasm`.

### Tests

```bash
cd contracts/attestation
cargo test
```

27 tests covering core attestation logic, fee calculation arithmetic, tier/volume discounts, combined discounts, fee toggling, access control, input validation, and a full economic simulation.

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --network testnet \
  --source <KEY> \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/veritasor_attestation.wasm
```
